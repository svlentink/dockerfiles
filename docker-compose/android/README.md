WIP does not work

# Android emulator

My goal is to have a simple android emulator.
Just get `create avd` and running it.


## Motivation

Some app needs permissions I do not trust them with.
Or they do not need in my opinion.
Since I do care about my personal data,
I want to run those apps in a sandbox env.
