# Convert wordpress with mysql to sqlite

First download an `archive.zip` from your Wordpress admin interface,
which can be created with [duplicator](https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/).

Now run the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/svlentink/dockerfiles/blob/master/svlentink/spark-connector/docker-compose.yml),
which will end with instructions to run it in a docker container,
or you can used a regular PHP enabled hoster.
